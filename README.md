# ChatGPT-Clone
The name OF this application id A.N.N-I (Artificial Nerdy Natrual-language Intelligence)
A very minimal clone of chatGPT which uses OpenAI's learning model to generate responses.

This clone was built using openAI's GPT 3.5 model using text-davinci-003. To run it simply cd in to the client server and run "npm run dev"

To run the server, cd into server and run "npm run server"

Then ask A.N.N-i anything

to use, you will require an API key from openAI(this is free) and an .env file. In your env file, save your api key in the enviroment variable "API_KEY". Save your ".env" file in the "server" folder
